1
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:19,774
Come on

2
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:22,209
Dammit.

3
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:24,879
Come on, you gotta
be kidding me.

4
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,416
I'm surprised it
lasted that long.

5
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,820
You know, you'd think
that a bunch of Mormons

6
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,389
who got together in their
little covered wagons

7
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,658
and made it all the way out west

8
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:39,727
to build their city on
top of a patch of salt,

9
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,630
that maybe, just maybe,
they'd build a radio tower.

10
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,364
But no, not the Mormons.

11
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:45,933
Well,

12
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:48,636
we're in Miller County.

13
00:02:49,804 --> 00:02:50,972
What's that mean?

14
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,640
It means there's not
so much as a gas station

15
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:53,675
between here and Nevada.

16
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,577
You should have brought a book.

17
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:58,579
Think
they'd spring for us

18
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,948
to be put up in Salt Lake
City for one night, huh?

19
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,050
One night.

20
00:03:02,116 --> 00:03:04,317
Salt Lake City?

21
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,620
- Yeah.
- What would you have done

22
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,754
in Salt Lake City?

23
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:07,822
Tipped cows?

24
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,390
You kidding me?

25
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,293
All those Mormon
girls with no booze,

26
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,930
no dancing, no culture,

27
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,565
just fighting over some frozen

28
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,399
- peckerwood preacher.
- Hey,

29
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:21,201
look sharp.

30
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,679
Is that our man?

31
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,916
Looks nothing like him.

32
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:38,218
Howdy.

33
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,724
Dang thing blew a gasket.

34
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,794
I don't think I can fix it.

35
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:49,564
I don't think you can.

36
00:03:50,497 --> 00:03:51,632
Ain't no water out here,

37
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,935
and Sulphurdale's
ten mile that way.

38
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,707
I'd be obliged if
you help me out.

39
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,743
Help with what?

40
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,746
You got a spare
gasket back there?

41
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:10,551
Well, I reckon, I don't
know for sure it's the gasket.

42
00:04:23,898 --> 00:04:25,600
I've been working on it all day.

43
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:27,802
It's all busted up.

44
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,038
This old jalopy's got
a ton of miles on her.

45
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,576
I'm lucky you came
along while you did.

46
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:39,180
Ain't nothing out here

47
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,616
but critters and
Mormons farming oats.

48
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:48,956
Ambush!

49
00:04:58,933 --> 00:04:59,801
Don't move.

50
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,270
Drop your guns or I shoot.

51
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,938
Both of you.

52
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,039
You move, I shoot him.

53
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,908
Okay.

54
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,042
Don't shoot.

55
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,912
I got 'em.

56
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,580
Crash, I got 'em.

57
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,048
Yeah.

58
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,315
He got 'em.

59
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:21,956
Pilgrims!

60
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,728
I am Crash Mooncalf with
the Crash Mooncalf Gang.

61
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,933
And I run this here
part of this here state.

62
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:37,071
And you passing through my
part of this here state,

63
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,472
means you owe me debt.

64
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:41,976
Jimmy!

65
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,646
Collect my debt, huh?

66
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,283
Mr. Mooncalf says
you owe debt, city boy.

67
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,718
I have no money.

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,856
He says he ain't got no money.

69
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,324
Bullshit!

70
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,860
That's a brand new car.

71
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:05,266
Those are brand new
fancy-pants suits, huh?

72
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,101
Fancy-pants suits.

73
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,203
If you don't put
your limp-wristed

74
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,805
hands high in the air

75
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:15,209
and step out with your
billfolds spilling cash money,

76
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:18,312
I'm gonna air you fuckers out.

77
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,981
Hey, we don't
want any trouble.

78
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,583
We'll give you our money, okay?

79
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,685
Tommy.

80
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,120
My billfold's in my pocket.

81
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,389
I'm gonna grab it slow.

82
00:06:30,258 --> 00:06:31,025
Don't shoot.

83
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,426
All right?

84
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:34,962
Here we go.

85
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:39,600
I got 600

86
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:41,869
right here.

87
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:42,536
Okay?

88
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,639
I got 600 right here.

89
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,008
My partner's got
a thousand.

90
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,910
Take the money, you let us go.

91
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:57,318
No!

92
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,264
Get 'em.

93
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,068
Hey!

94
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:15,169
Hold your fire!

95
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,138
You down there!

96
00:07:18,306 --> 00:07:19,573
It's just the two of you.

97
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,575
Now, drop your guns.

98
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,278
Can't do that, Mr. Mooncalf!

99
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:26,347
My name is Frank Fenton.

100
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,083
My partner and I
are U.S. Marshals.

101
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,718
I have a warrant for your arrest

102
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,553
signed by a federal
magistrate judge

103
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,789
in Ormsby County, Nevada.

104
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,991
That means drop
your guns, dumbass!

105
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,694
Nothing doing, Marshal.

106
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,463
I got a bead on
your man in the car.

107
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,166
You drop your guns.

108
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,901
He ain't got a
bead on shit, Frank.

109
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,103
There's no need to spill
any more blood today,

110
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,137
Mr. Mooncalf.

111
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:52,773
Let's negotiate.

112
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,108
Negotiate?

113
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,142
I can talk him down.

114
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,580
Mr. Mooncalf, use your head.

115
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,716
You got two marshals right here

116
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,518
and a hundred on your
tail if we go down.

117
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,121
There's only one way this ends.

118
00:08:07,188 --> 00:08:08,856
I'm a crack shot.

119
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,960
We're both crack shots.

120
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:14,362
You best back off.

121
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,464
You best back off!

122
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,165
We can take them, Frank.

123
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,968
There's only one
way, Mr. Mooncalf.

124
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,003
You know that.

125
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:24,038
Come on!

126
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:29,210
Damn you, Marshal!

127
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:31,145
Damn it, Tommy!

128
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:35,583
Cover me!

129
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:49,597
Hot damn, Frank.

130
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,965
I got that sucker
dead to rights.

131
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:51,665
You see that?

132
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,200
What in the hell was that?

133
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,335
What?

134
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:55,504
What?

135
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,804
Don't put your hands on me.

136
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:59,106
Our job is serving warrants

137
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:00,474
and bringing in fugitives alive.

138
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,176
You know that!

139
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,377
For God's sake, we had him.

140
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:04,345
He would have surrendered.

141
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,714
He wasn't gonna surrender.

142
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,249
I did the job so
you didn't have to.

143
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,417
You're welcome.

144
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:10,317
Don't you walk away from me.

145
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,186
Don't you touch me!

146
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,254
You negotiate first.

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,523
Then shoot.

148
00:09:14,588 --> 00:09:17,091
You do not go in guns
blazing every time!

149
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:22,229
That gang killed
families, Frank.

150
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,100
We stopped the bad guys.

151
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,202
That's the job.

152
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:29,770
Tommy,

153
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,173
this isn't a cowboy movie.

154
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:36,511
Yeah, well, sometimes
a cowboy's what you need.

155
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:37,845
I'm gonna call it in.

156
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,500
Fillin' her up?

157
00:09:59,568 --> 00:10:01,068
Just topping off.

158
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,938
You here for the sheriff?

159
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,343
Only reason anybody in a
suit's gonna be in Gilead

160
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,446
is to drive down to the
county seat in Fort Tipton

161
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:14,148
and see the sheriff.

162
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,251
Is that so?

163
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:21,155
Well, ever since the murders.

164
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,964
The sheriff ain't in his office.

165
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:30,798
Where is he?

166
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:32,933
He's up off the
State Line Road

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,235
at the McCluskey homestead.

168
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:36,937
What's left of it.

169
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,340
Well, I guess
that's where we're headed.

170
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,477
Yep, well,

171
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,312
they was murdered.

172
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:46,380
The McCluskeys.

173
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,049
All of 'em.

174
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,419
You need anything for the road?

175
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:56,490
I'll take a 7-UP.

176
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:58,959
Got anything a
little stronger?

177
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,333
Hey, you want one?

178
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,368
No, thanks.

179
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:09,403
Suit yourself.

180
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:21,148
We got the federal warrant
served before lunch.

181
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,284
What do you think the odds
are we can make it a twofer

182
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,021
and get this rinky dink state
warrant served before supper?

183
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,056
I wouldn't hold my breath.

184
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,326
This one might get complicated.

185
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,519
Sheriff.

186
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,420
What?

187
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,287
I'm Frank Fenton.

188
00:12:00,354 --> 00:12:01,523
This is my partner, Tom.

189
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,990
We're U.S. Marshals.

190
00:12:04,358 --> 00:12:05,292
Marshals?

191
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:07,728
Where's the coroner?

192
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:12,399
Paiute
County has no coroner.

193
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,902
They got me and my deputy.

194
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:17,338
Yeah, middle of
nowhere here, huh?

195
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,305
I live here.

196
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:19,541
This is Paiute country.

197
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:23,110
Only flat dicks in DC think
this is the middle of nowhere.

198
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,078
Now pick that up.

199
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,218
And, uh, feel free
to look around.

200
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,392
Best we can tell is that
the perps entered here.

201
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,029
And whoever kicked the
door in was not invited.

202
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,498
Any idea who did this?

203
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, Benjamin Bonney.

204
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,269
You here to serve him a warrant?

205
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,572
Yeah, we're here
to serve his warrant.

206
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:52,273
You sure it was him?

207
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,941
Dead positive.

208
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:57,211
Anybody who lives within
a mile of his ranch,

209
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,813
he shoots them in the head and
just burns down their house.

210
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,149
And not a
single speck of evidence?

211
00:13:02,216 --> 00:13:03,150
That's right.

212
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,151
He's real good.

213
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:07,187
Not one speck of
evidence until last week.

214
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,324
We found a casing
that's matched his iron.

215
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,792
How far away is his ranch?

216
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:13,827
Uh...

217
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,130
See that other side
of that mountain?

218
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:20,167
He lives up there with
these three half-wit sons.

219
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,335
Three sons?

220
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:24,004
Yeah, Noah, Ahab, and Joe.

221
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:25,640
Now I've never really seen Joe,

222
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,474
but I've heard a lot about him.

223
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:32,079
Every crime scene always
had four sets of footprints.

224
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,214
So they're all involved.

225
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:40,354
Son of a bitch.

226
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,355
Three kids.

227
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:42,524
Dossier said two, right?

228
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:49,330
"Benjamin Bonney,
born 8/18/1902, Gilead,"

229
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,197
uh, blah blah.

230
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:52,032
"Married in 1924.

231
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,034
Produced two offspring,

232
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,370
two sons, Ahab and Noah."

233
00:13:56,437 --> 00:13:57,404
Two.

234
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,674
So who's this Joe kid, huh?

235
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,576
Some illegitimate half-breed?

236
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,979
Look, the warrant is
for Benjamin Bonney.

237
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,482
We just gotta bring in one guy.

238
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:11,285
We play it smart.

239
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,086
We feel it out.

240
00:14:13,454 --> 00:14:15,724
Well, you better find
us a motel with a bar.

241
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,375
Hey, pigtails.

242
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:35,510
Can I get another tequila?

243
00:14:36,811 --> 00:14:38,145
Actually, make it two.

244
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:41,248
Two more coming up.

245
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:44,118
So there's
something I don't get.

246
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,553
What don't you get, Tommy?

247
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,487
Why us?

248
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,256
Why'd they send a
couple of marshals

249
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:50,792
to this little podunk hickville

250
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:52,393
to serve a county warrant?

251
00:14:53,728 --> 00:14:55,396
I mean, I get the
sheriff's outgunned.

252
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,497
Look at that guy.

253
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:57,665
He could barely stand.

254
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,803
But why did the
FBI kick it down?

255
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,972
Well, I'm sure our
friends at the FBI

256
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,274
didn't want to deal with
a couple of dead miners

257
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:08,576
in Indian country.

258
00:15:08,643 --> 00:15:11,478
So we got sent on a milk
run after the Mooncalf grab.

259
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:14,849
Seems pretty cut
and dried to me.

260
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,618
I just don't get why
the FBI passed on it.

261
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:18,085
Here you go, boys.

262
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:21,455
Much obliged.

263
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:23,525
Now what is your name?

264
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:25,426
Name's Callie.

265
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,162
You here about the murders?

266
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:32,634
Ooh, cat's out of the
bag, Frank.

267
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,601
Shot?

268
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:35,436
No, thank you.

269
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,273
You think it's land
they're after, the Bonneys?

270
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,240
Well,

271
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,644
hell.

272
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,412
Anyone with any sense knows so.

273
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,449
Is that right?

274
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:51,519
Them boys got a grudge and
they'll spill blood over it.

275
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,723
Ben Bonney's daddy
owned 10,000 acres

276
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,525
of God's country around here.

277
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,695
Largest ranch in the mine area.

278
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,632
When he went off and
got killed by the Indians,

279
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:10,738
the bank took it,
sold it off in plots,

280
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,307
and I bought one of them plots.

281
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,243
You see, there ain't nobody
got no recollection of it

282
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,913
except Ben Bonney
and a few others.

283
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,148
A man thinks something's
rightfully his

284
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,751
and it gets took from
him's a dangerous man.

285
00:16:24,652 --> 00:16:27,054
Ben Bonney's even worse.

286
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,724
So he's trying to buy back
the land at bottom dollar?

287
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:33,561
Hell, he low-balled me
to the tune of $20 an acre.

288
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,263
Turned him down.

289
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,434
Next week, had two dead
horses shot through the head.

290
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,741
He come back the next day,
offered me $10 an acre.

291
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,408
Did you take it?

292
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:52,680
Nope.

293
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:55,115
I like this guy.

294
00:16:57,552 --> 00:16:58,987
I always figured

295
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:01,890
my end would be the
bottom of a mine shaft,

296
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,024
inflation would run me off,

297
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:06,594
or Soviet Reds would get me.

298
00:17:07,962 --> 00:17:10,397
I never ever dreamed

299
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:13,801
it'd be the cloven-hoofed
devil himself.

300
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,342
Ma'am.

301
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:28,750
How about that?

302
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,853
We get to arrest the
cloven-hoofed devil himself.

303
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,756
The whole country's gone to
half to hell if you ask me.

304
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,390
Mama'd spin in her grave.

305
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:40,260
If it's not murderers,
it's the communists.

306
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:42,730
Didn't used to be like this.

307
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:45,365
It won't always be like this.

308
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:51,104
That's how you flirt?

309
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,473
Mind your business. Tommy.

310
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:57,512
So this
Benjamin Bonney guy, right?

311
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,713
He's out there, what?

312
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,849
Killing landowners and
then buying up the plots?

313
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,851
And he thinks he's not
gonna get caught.

314
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:07,487
- What?

315
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:08,990
Oh, come on, Tommy.

316
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:10,157
Shh.

317
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:12,827
Hi, boys.

318
00:18:12,894 --> 00:18:14,394
Hello, yourself.

319
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:16,631
What's your name?

320
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:17,799
Dinah.

321
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:18,666
What's yours?

322
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:19,801
Tommy.

323
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:20,868
You want a drink?

324
00:18:20,935 --> 00:18:21,869
Sure.

325
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,641
Don't mind if I do

326
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,811
Hot damn, Dinah.

327
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,012
Where are you from?

328
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:32,647
Twin Falls, Idaho.

329
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,448
- Idaho?
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:18:34,515 --> 00:18:36,951
What-what are you doing
all the way down here?

331
00:18:37,018 --> 00:18:39,587
Oh, just looking
for a boyfriend.

332
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:42,322
It might be you if you
play your cards right.

333
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:44,324
Miss, we're U.S. Marshals.

334
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,628
Is that a crime?

335
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,930
No.

336
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,832
Just keep it above
board, please.

337
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:52,066
Mm.

338
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,868
My son likes those.

339
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,135
He's four.

340
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,205
So, you got a girlfriend?

341
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,540
Well, I
think I might now.

342
00:18:59,607 --> 00:19:00,240
Mm.

343
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,542
You staying here?

344
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:02,543
I am.

345
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,645
Just outside.

346
00:19:03,711 --> 00:19:05,079
Uh, Tommy, we're marshals.

347
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,380
Yeah, you said that already.

348
00:19:06,446 --> 00:19:07,381
Frank.

349
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,383
You think I'm a prostitute?

350
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,552
You think I'm trying
to take his money?

351
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,720
Well, I'm not.

352
00:19:12,787 --> 00:19:14,088
I'm not for sale.

353
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,489
I just...

354
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:17,759
I like Tommy.

355
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,562
And you're gonna give
me some gas money

356
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,931
to get back home to my
little boy next week?

357
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,633
Well, that only sounds fair.

358
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,702
$20?

359
00:19:28,936 --> 00:19:30,638
Hey, Frank, can I borrow $10?

360
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:32,573
I'm kidding.

361
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,641
All right.

362
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,876
That sounds fair to me.

363
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:37,912
Frank, don't you
wait up.

364
00:19:37,979 --> 00:19:39,647
How's it going, darling?

365
00:19:39,714 --> 00:19:40,915
Look at that dress.

366
00:19:40,982 --> 00:19:41,916
I love the way it moves.

367
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:43,483
- Take it off.
- I cannot wait

368
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:44,919
to see what it looks like
on the floor.

369
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,826
Left you with the bill, huh?

370
00:19:54,128 --> 00:19:55,395
I'll collect on it.

371
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:57,765
Smoke?

372
00:19:57,832 --> 00:19:58,733
No, thank you.

373
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,869
I gave them up 10 years ago.

374
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,006
You really a marshal?

375
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:06,206
I am.

376
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,577
And you're really
going after the Bonneys?

377
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:10,545
Looks that way.

378
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,614
Drinks on the house.

379
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,917
Whole valley's scared
to go near them.

380
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:16,884
Oh.

381
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:18,920
Well, thank you, Callie.

382
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:21,421
They're dangerous.

383
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:25,059
Next time you might need
something a little stronger.

384
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:26,493
All right.

385
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,730
I got six shots in my pistol,

386
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:30,898
and every one of them's
got your name on it.

387
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,770
Well, well, well, if
it ain't Durango Jack.

388
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:39,874
Last I heard you were lightin'
out for Indian territory.

389
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,479
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

390
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:46,446
- Yeah, here you go.
- Yeah, right there.

391
00:20:46,514 --> 00:20:47,347
Here you go, here you go.

392
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,583
All right.

393
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,284
Confound
you, Durango Jack!

394
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:24,852
Lo and behold, church
on wheels.

395
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:26,621
Quite a sight, isn't it?

396
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:27,588
Yeah.

397
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:29,724
What, are you some
kind of preacher?

398
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,758
That I am.

399
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:34,929
Reverend Cassidy
Whitaker at your service.

400
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,063
My friends call me Cass.

401
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:38,266
Frank.

402
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,134
How do you do Frank?

403
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,069
I've never seen a
traveling church before.

404
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,807
You mean you've never seen
a man roam from town to town,

405
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:49,911
in a preacher wagon, bothering
strange men in parking lots?

406
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,379
You gotta get out more, Frank.

407
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:54,081
You starting a revival?

408
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,817
There's already a revival.

409
00:21:56,751 --> 00:21:58,753
I'm just bringing
it to Paiute County.

410
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,654
Hm.

411
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,923
First altar call
tomorrow night.

412
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,058
Free Bible if you want it.

413
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,726
Oh.

414
00:22:05,793 --> 00:22:08,930
Yeah, the Gideons
beat you to that one.

415
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:09,997
You got me there.

416
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,301
Of course, the Gideons
can't give you more

417
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,002
than what fits in a drawer.

418
00:22:15,837 --> 00:22:16,838
But Frank,

419
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:18,973
this place

420
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,109
is special.

421
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,778
I can feel it.

422
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:26,446
A man in your line of
work might benefit.

423
00:22:26,514 --> 00:22:28,249
What kind of work is that?

424
00:22:28,316 --> 00:22:31,085
Well, you're a man
of the law, aren't you?

425
00:22:31,152 --> 00:22:31,919
How'd you guess?

426
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:34,387
Turn around

427
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:36,624
- What?
- Turn around.

428
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:37,859
I'm unarmed.

429
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:40,728
Shh.

430
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,704
Shoulders of a law man.

431
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:54,441
A thousand burdens in
every fiber of muscle.

432
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,944
You're still holding it tight.

433
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,480
What are you,
some kind of shrink?

434
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:02,049
Just a man of the Lord, Frank.

435
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:06,554
But you don't need to have
religion to call me a friend.

436
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:08,155
I've been down some hard roads.

437
00:23:09,456 --> 00:23:12,026
You ever need an ear or
a hand or anything else,

438
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:13,928
I'm your man.

439
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,497
Thank you.

440
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:19,533
I'm an Evangelist, baby.

441
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,168
Good will don't cost me a thing.

442
00:23:23,104 --> 00:23:26,641
I'm gonna catch some shut
eye in the preacher wagon.

443
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:29,010
You have yourself a good night.

444
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,480
Hey, you too.

445
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,182
Thank you.

446
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:46,394
7AM.

447
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,228
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

448
00:23:47,295 --> 00:23:48,562
No.

449
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:49,597
- Where's my wallet?
- Right now?

450
00:23:49,664 --> 00:23:51,431
Rise and shine, kiddo.

451
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:52,800
I gotta
go, I gotta go.

452
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:53,868
I gotta go.

453
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,204
Hey.

454
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,039
Hey.

455
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,472
Be safe, baby doll.

456
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,875
I'll see you tonight.

457
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:01,809
Yeah.

458
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:08,049
Mm.

459
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,016
Don't get shot.

460
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,258
Is that coffee?

461
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,926
Oh, man.

462
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:19,894
Is she staying?

463
00:24:21,195 --> 00:24:22,330
Yeah.

464
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,332
She needed gas
money and then, uh,

465
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:26,499
turns out her engine
needed an overhaul,

466
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,036
so I had to work
on that all night.

467
00:24:30,871 --> 00:24:31,839
Jesus.

468
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:36,978
All right, Casanova, it's
time to clock in.

469
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:56,964
What the hell?

470
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:09,210
I need a bullet.

471
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,878
Grab a canteen.

472
00:25:12,213 --> 00:25:13,214
Shoot me.

473
00:25:15,082 --> 00:25:16,283
I need a bullet.

474
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,152
Hang on, pal, we're
getting you water.

475
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,053
Shoot me.

476
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,958
Sh-sh-shoot...

477
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,895
Sh-sh-sh-shoot me.
Shoot me.

478
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,300
Shoot me.

479
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:48,115
Shoot me.

480
00:25:57,324 --> 00:25:58,659
What did you do?

481
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,227
I put him out of his misery.

482
00:26:01,462 --> 00:26:02,863
You heard him.

483
00:26:04,265 --> 00:26:06,000
Poor bastard was begging for it.

484
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:16,277
Frank,

485
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:18,879
are you all right?

486
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:19,847
Yes.

487
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,383
Yeah, I'm all right.

488
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,317
I'm all right.

489
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,287
I get like that too sometimes.

490
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:35,229
Call it in.

491
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:51,846
That's Don Burgess.

492
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,416
At least he had the common
courtesy to shoot him.

493
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,084
I shot him.

494
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,222
I think you did
the right thing.

495
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:03,124
Poor bastard.

496
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,926
That's one hell of a way to go.

497
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,462
Sheriff,

498
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,930
the whole place is done for.

499
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:12,466
Shack's burnt down and
the horses shot dead.

500
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:14,268
Same as the McCluskey place.

501
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:16,605
We met him last night in town.

502
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,105
- Hm.
- He gave us reason to believe

503
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,941
Bonney has some sort of
ties to the land here.

504
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,177
Yeah, I heard that.

505
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,247
And?

506
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:27,214
Can't you check?

507
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:31,252
Don't you have a
courthouse here?

508
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,820
We keep our archives

509
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:36,824
in the basement of the
courthouse in Fort Tipton.

510
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,792
But it mysteriously burnt down

511
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,362
two weeks before
these murders started.

512
00:27:41,428 --> 00:27:42,796
Huh.

513
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,465
Covering his tracks.

514
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:45,966
Well,

515
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:48,402
we'll have him at the
business end of a gun soon.

516
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:53,140
I'm telling you, they
are very dangerous men,

517
00:27:53,207 --> 00:27:55,809
so you and Barney Fife
here better watch your ass.

518
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:00,214
All right there.

519
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:23,070
Big ol' fancy ranch with
no cattle and no horses.

520
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,439
And they got a storage barn,

521
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,308
but they aren't growing crops.

522
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,410
Get out!

523
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:37,084
Hey, we're unarmed!

524
00:28:38,152 --> 00:28:39,554
Stop shooting!

525
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:41,388
State
your business!

526
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:42,323
We're Mormon!

527
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,559
Mormons?

528
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:47,261
That doesn't help your case any.

529
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,097
Hey, stop it!

530
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,434
I'm offering you diplomacy here.

531
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,572
Beg your pardon,
Mormon, but I'm no diplomat.

532
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,306
What we gonna do here, Frank?

533
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,209
What are we gonna do, Frank?

534
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,446
Sir, what are we gonna do?

535
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:09,883
What are we gonna do?

536
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,179
Tommy,

537
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:40,481
cover me!

538
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:55,329
Shit!

539
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:58,332
Tommy, get over here!

540
00:30:04,706 --> 00:30:06,006
Drop your guns or
I throw grenades

541
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:08,142
through every window
of this house!

542
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,547
Congratulations.

543
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:13,782
You're the first pair of Mormons

544
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:16,584
to ever shoot their way
through the front door.

545
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:18,352
Are you Benjamin Bonney?

546
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,187
I am not.

547
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:21,355
I'm Mickey Mouse.

548
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:24,224
And these are my
associates, Jim and Judy.

549
00:30:25,292 --> 00:30:26,360
Hi.

550
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:27,762
Nice to meet you.

551
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,330
You come to plug holes
in the front of my house?

552
00:30:29,396 --> 00:30:31,566
Tell you what, why don't
you join us for dinner?

553
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:35,269
You.

554
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:36,303
What's your name?

555
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,372
Ahab.

556
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:39,273
Ahab.

557
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,041
And you?

558
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,010
Noah?

559
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:45,379
That's right

560
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:46,480
Where is Joe?

561
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:51,085
I'm beginning to suspect that
you're not actually Mormons.

562
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,954
No, no, wait.

563
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:55,322
Give me a minute.

564
00:30:55,389 --> 00:30:56,290
Don't tell me.

565
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:58,793
You're U.S. Marshals

566
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,295
and you're here 'cause
you got something to say.

567
00:31:01,362 --> 00:31:03,197
Yeah, we do.

568
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:04,699
We have a warrant
for your arrest

569
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,735
on the charge of capital murder.

570
00:31:06,801 --> 00:31:09,370
Capital murder?
Oh, good heavens.

571
00:31:09,436 --> 00:31:10,705
I'd better comply.

572
00:31:10,772 --> 00:31:12,139
Gentlemen, here are my wrists.

573
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,275
Just slap the irons on me and
drag me off to the hangman.

574
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:19,413
That is exactly what
we're going to do.

575
00:31:21,014 --> 00:31:23,484
You will have your day in
court if you come peacefully.

576
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:24,753
Oh, did you hear that?

577
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,554
I'm going to get
my day in court.

578
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,155
Yeah.

579
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,958
Uh, you know, uh, if you please,
Marshals, I was wondering

580
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:34,796
if I can have a look at
a copy of that warrant.

581
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:36,897
That'd help me come
along peacefully.

582
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,534
Yeah.

583
00:31:40,835 --> 00:31:43,070
Issued by a
Paiute County judge.

584
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,543
Hm.

585
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,244
Well, now, you must be mistaken.

586
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:53,914
Um, it says here it's
issued on November 13th

587
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:57,284
and that was, uh,
well over a week ago.

588
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,520
That's right.

589
00:31:58,586 --> 00:32:00,154
Warrants don't expire.

590
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,725
Well, I was wondering if they
kept a copy of that warrant

591
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:06,460
in the Paiute County courthouse.

592
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:07,562
I would assume so.

593
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:10,097
I would assume so, too.

594
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:13,367
May I, uh, may I make a
phone call to the courthouse?

595
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:15,969
Maybe that'd help me
not resist the, uh...

596
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,472
I'll make the call.

597
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:30,250
Operator, connect me to the
Paiute County courthouse.

598
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:33,987
You fight in the war?

599
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,692
You got that look about you.

600
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,528
Probably the right age.

601
00:32:40,595 --> 00:32:42,564
You want to see what I
brought back from Saipan?

602
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,702
I cut the tongue
out of every Jap

603
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,236
I stuck my bayonet through.

604
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:52,372
He was in Germany.

605
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,842
Tank command.

606
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,743
Killed 40 Krauts in
the Hurtgen forest.

607
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:58,513
How many was it?

608
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,180
About 40.

609
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,317
You're on the
wrong ranch, peckerwood.

610
00:33:13,561 --> 00:33:16,230
How about I make a
souvenir necklace of my own?

611
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,665
Now, now.

612
00:33:17,732 --> 00:33:18,900
Frank.

613
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,568
You got anything you
wanna say to your son,

614
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:21,569
you better say it now.

615
00:33:22,904 --> 00:33:24,304
Calm it down, come on.

616
00:33:24,973 --> 00:33:26,106
Calm it down.

617
00:33:26,908 --> 00:33:28,208
I am calm.

618
00:33:29,443 --> 00:33:31,679
Yes, yes, this
is Officer Morton

619
00:33:31,746 --> 00:33:34,381
with the U.S. Marshal Service.

620
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:36,918
Calling to check on a
status of a warrant,

621
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:40,487
issue 13 November,
one Benjamin Bonney.

622
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,356
Yes, ma'am.

623
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,526
Yes.

624
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:47,027
Uh-huh.

625
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,195
Are you sure?

626
00:33:49,263 --> 00:33:50,097
Yes.

627
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:52,065
Thank you, ma'am.

628
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,743
The warrant's been remanded.

629
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:02,911
What?

630
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:05,780
The warrant was
remanded yesterday.

631
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:10,150
The county clerk's office
forgot to notify the sheriff.

632
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,886
Why weren't we
notified by the field office?

633
00:34:11,953 --> 00:34:13,721
Now here's what's
gonna happen.

634
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:16,791
Joe Bonney's outside
50 yards away

635
00:34:16,858 --> 00:34:19,994
with a rifle ready to blow a
hole in the side of your head

636
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,963
the second you step
out that front door.

637
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,397
Now I don't want to
filthy up my floor

638
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:24,933
with a couple of dead marshals,

639
00:34:24,999 --> 00:34:27,869
not any more than it's
already been filthied,

640
00:34:27,936 --> 00:34:30,137
even though I'd be
justified in doing so

641
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:32,439
'cause you never identified
yourselves as marshals.

642
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:33,975
You start shooting up
the front of my house.

643
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:36,010
I have two witnesses for it.

644
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:39,647
Now, you fly back to
wherever you came from

645
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:40,615
and don't ever come back here,

646
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:42,449
and I won't have to
bleach your skulls

647
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:45,185
and send them home to your
mothers for Christmas.

648
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:49,724
How's that for
diplomacy, Mormons?

649
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:55,597
I'll take
that as a yes, sir,

650
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:58,265
and thank you for not
cutting my nuts off.

651
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,499
Now, if you don't want Joe

652
00:34:59,567 --> 00:35:02,336
to splatter your brains
all over the front yard,

653
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,403
you throw down your guns,

654
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,672
you strip down to
your bare asses,

655
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,274
you take your Walt
Disney Storybook warrant,

656
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:09,443
and you get the fuck
out of my house!

657
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:28,462
Call him.

658
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:32,033
Yes.

659
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,835
I-I don't, I don't understand

660
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,637
how something like
that gets lost

661
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:39,339
Okay.

662
00:35:45,947 --> 00:35:47,280
Field office confirmed it.

663
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,485
Warrant was remanded yesterday
by somebody higher up.

664
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,554
The sheriff wasn't in the loop.

665
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:55,623
CO says the evidence
went missing.

666
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,893
That's great news, Frank.

667
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:02,396
Courthouse building burns
up all the vital records.

668
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,898
Evidence goes magically missing,

669
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:06,199
and some redneck hillbilly

670
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:08,402
tyrant takes our
service pistols.

671
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,170
Man, we look like true
professionals, don't we?

672
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,371
I don't like it either--

673
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,306
I can't eve
get a damn light!

674
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:17,078
Now what was all
that back there, huh?

675
00:36:17,145 --> 00:36:18,613
You shooting up the place

676
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,348
after giving me your little
lecture on procedure?

677
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,418
It was nothing, all right?

678
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:25,687
Didn't look like nothing.

679
00:36:25,753 --> 00:36:27,454
All right, look,
let's go to a pawn shop,

680
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:29,090
pick up a couple of pistols.

681
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,424
We'll stay the night in Gilead,

682
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,192
head back in the
morning, close it out.

683
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,863
As far as I'm concerned, this
is the FBI's problem now.

684
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:38,432
All right.

685
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,737
I'm still pissed they had
clothes that fit you and not me.

686
00:36:42,804 --> 00:36:43,805
Luck of the draw.

687
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:46,473
Can you at least
give me the belt?

688
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,508
Nope.

689
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:54,949
Hey.

690
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,518
7AM?

691
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,353
We're not in a
hurry to go anywhere.

692
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,158
Let me sleep in, huh?

693
00:37:04,224 --> 00:37:05,026
Hiya, Tommy.

694
00:37:05,093 --> 00:37:06,661
Well, hello, gorgeous.

695
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:07,327
What are you wearing?

696
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:09,329
What are you wearing?

697
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,699
Take it off.

698
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:22,577
So this
man, this Zen lunatic,

699
00:37:22,643 --> 00:37:26,480
this Jesus Christ,
this Son of God,

700
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,649
this man who transforms men

701
00:37:28,716 --> 00:37:32,920
and restores him to the land
that once bore him bounty,

702
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:39,493
this man from the bosom
of the earth brought life,

703
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:44,966
and it is this life in abundance
that Jesus promises us.

704
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:47,501
Howdy, Frank.

705
00:37:48,803 --> 00:37:52,607
Transformation makes
the broken world holy,

706
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:57,310
the skin holy, the nose holy,

707
00:37:58,246 --> 00:38:02,016
the tongue and cock
and asshole holy.

708
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:06,921
Transformation

709
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,290
makes the soul holy.

710
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:13,694
Okay, boys.

711
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:15,930
You go tonight with
the blessings of Jesus.

712
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:22,904
Have a seat, Frank.

713
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,005
You look spent.

714
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,976
Mind if I smoke my pipe?

715
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:30,978
Not at all.

716
00:38:33,781 --> 00:38:36,083
I've never seen
a preacher smoke.

717
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,518
Listen, Frank.

718
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,921
If the good Lord didn't
create all manner of plants

719
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:41,656
on the third day of creation

720
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:46,459
so we could bunch 'em up into
a piece of hollowed out wood,

721
00:38:46,527 --> 00:38:50,731
and smoke our little hearts out,

722
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't know why He
created them at all.

723
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,403
Don't deny yourself for my sake.

724
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,006
I don't smoke.

725
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:00,407
I quit

726
00:39:00,473 --> 00:39:01,943
after the war.

727
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:02,910
I just, uh,

728
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,848
needed to do things
a different way.

729
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,991
You know, they used to, uh,
put lithium in this stuff.

730
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,425
Uh-huh.

731
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:20,360
Why are you here, Frank?

732
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:23,463
Tonight, here at this hotel?

733
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,869
It's the only
motel in 50 miles.

734
00:39:29,737 --> 00:39:31,772
It was this patch of
concrete or a tent.

735
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:34,141
You know why I'm here?

736
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,343
Why is that?

737
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:37,178
I was reading the
book of Genesis,

738
00:39:37,245 --> 00:39:39,013
the first book of the Bible.

739
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,317
I was reading the story
about this man named Jacob,

740
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:46,854
son of Isaac,
grandson of Abraham.

741
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:49,891
He spent a great deal
of his life in turmoil.

742
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,159
Gilead was the name of the place

743
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:57,064
where he laid that turmoil down
and made peace with himself.

744
00:39:58,232 --> 00:39:59,967
That spoke to me.

745
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,702
That's why I'm in Gilead.

746
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,872
I know as a lawman you're
in Gilead because of...

747
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:07,708
Well, you must be on
some kind of assignment.

748
00:40:07,775 --> 00:40:09,644
But I want to know
why you're here,

749
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:14,749
in this patch of concrete,
sitting across from me,

750
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,252
when you could be anywhere
else in Gilead, Nevada

751
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,688
you want to be right now.

752
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,890
You want to know why I'm here?

753
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,091
Mm-hmm.

754
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,460
I'll tell you.

755
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,965
It's not because of
some divine path.

756
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:36,971
There's a man in this
valley killing people.

757
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,007
I'm here to stop him.

758
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:42,910
Only I can't.

759
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,747
He found a loophole
to keep on doing it,

760
00:40:47,715 --> 00:40:49,083
so I'm packing up
and I'm going home.

761
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:52,053
It's that simple, Reverend.

762
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,957
There's no neat, tidy
bow to the story.

763
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:58,693
No happy ending.

764
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:00,861
No angels and beams of light.

765
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,001
No disrespect, just,

766
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,005
not everything means something.

767
00:41:12,206 --> 00:41:13,808
You got a hunger, Frank,

768
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:18,879
and a thirst that transcends
your circumstance.

769
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:24,919
I can see it in the way
you hold your shoulders.

770
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:29,123
The Lord promises bounty, and
I think you chose this place

771
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:31,892
because you're here to be fed.

772
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:36,130
There's no bounty for me here.

773
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,001
It's just another mission.

774
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:09,797
Captain, we have
to order the men

775
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:11,832
to pull back to the bridge.

776
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:14,001
Sir, Murphy's still
pinned down out there.

777
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:15,069
We can't leave him.

778
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:18,305
We don't have the fire
power to get this thing down.

779
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,240
We have to pull back.

780
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:21,342
Order your men to pull back.

781
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,343
He's gonna die.

782
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:23,577
We're all gonna die.

783
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:26,547
That thing can't be stopped!

784
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:30,184
Fall back! Fall back!

785
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:31,619
Fall back to the bridge!

786
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:33,487
Sir, we cannot leave him.

787
00:42:33,554 --> 00:42:34,955
He's already dead!

788
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,425
I'm ordering you!

789
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,894
Fall back, now, Captain.

790
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:43,164
I'm not leaving him to die!

791
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,331
Goddamn it, Captain!

792
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:45,433
Look around you.

793
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:46,333
We don't have armor.

794
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,234
We don't have fire support.

795
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:48,537
We don't have a goddamn bazooka.

796
00:42:48,602 --> 00:42:50,104
This whole thing is fubar!

797
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,238
Now I'm ordering you.

798
00:42:51,305 --> 00:42:54,041
Get your ass over that hill now!

799
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:56,911
Now, soldier!

800
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,736
Fire!

801
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,372
- Well, hey, there.
- Hey, Callie.

802
00:44:33,207 --> 00:44:34,108
You got a light?

803
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,044
I thought you didn't smoke.

804
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:39,380
I've been corrupted.

805
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:41,448
By what?

806
00:44:43,552 --> 00:44:44,985
Circumstance.

807
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:48,389
Today was a mess.

808
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,157
You found the Bonneys?

809
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:51,091
I did.

810
00:44:52,726 --> 00:44:55,462
Doesn't matter, not a damn
thing I can do about it.

811
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,067
They're at home safe and sound
and, uh, we're off the case.

812
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:03,737
We're headed out tomorrow.

813
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:07,007
Uh, I'll take a
7-UP if you got one cold.

814
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,811
I hate to break it to
you, but I'm all out.

815
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:13,080
Bar's closing in a
half an hour anyway.

816
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:14,982
I'll leave you to it.

817
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,951
Ah, there's a vending
machine around the corner.

818
00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:19,486
On me.

819
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:23,958
Thank you.

820
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:28,062
You owe me one if
you ever come back.

821
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:30,297
All right.

822
00:45:33,334 --> 00:45:35,336
Goodnight, Callie.

823
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:55,256
Tommy!

824
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:02,496
It's me. It's me.

825
00:46:02,564 --> 00:46:03,598
Call an ambulance.

826
00:46:03,665 --> 00:46:05,332
Call an ambulance!

827
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:10,037
She's dead.

828
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:12,039
We got him.

829
00:46:22,584 --> 00:46:24,084
Hey, who sent you, huh?

830
00:46:24,151 --> 00:46:25,219
Who sent you?

831
00:46:25,286 --> 00:46:26,521
Was it the Bonneys?

832
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:27,656
Was it the Bonneys?

833
00:46:27,722 --> 00:46:28,757
- Tommy, he's dead.
- Who sent you?

834
00:46:28,822 --> 00:46:29,990
I swear, I'm gonna
blow your head off.

835
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:31,058
Tommy!

836
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,002
Sheriff says he's a drifter.

837
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:18,906
There's no way to tie him
to anybody, so that's that.

838
00:47:21,776 --> 00:47:23,477
She's dead, Frank.

839
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:26,980
Benjamin Bonney put
a hit out on us.

840
00:47:29,083 --> 00:47:31,118
And now some poor
bastard is an orphan.

841
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:35,456
I'm gonna kill him, Frank.

842
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,125
Hey.

843
00:47:39,661 --> 00:47:40,994
We're off the case.

844
00:47:42,564 --> 00:47:43,964
We're going home.

845
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:49,002
They got you in room four.

846
00:48:26,674 --> 00:48:27,908
Tommy!

847
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:35,482
Tommy!

848
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,926
I'm just
trying to find out

849
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:19,226
who remanded the warrant.

850
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,395
I already told
you, I don't know.

851
00:49:21,462 --> 00:49:23,130
Now stop raising
your voice at me.

852
00:49:23,197 --> 00:49:24,298
I'm not raising
my voice at you.

853
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:25,165
- I'm just trying to-
- Tommy,

854
00:49:25,232 --> 00:49:26,233
what the hell are you doing?

855
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,635
I'm trying to get
some answers, Frank.

856
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:28,502
Who remanded it?

857
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,537
Was it the sheriff?

858
00:49:29,604 --> 00:49:30,839
Get out!

859
00:49:30,905 --> 00:49:33,373
Tommy, Tommy, listen to me.

860
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,876
You're not gonna get
anywhere by scaring-

861
00:49:34,943 --> 00:49:36,210
No, you know what I'm
not gonna do, Frank?

862
00:49:36,276 --> 00:49:38,011
I'm not gonna stand around
with a thumb up my ass

863
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,581
while Benjamin
Bonney goes around

864
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:40,849
murdering hundreds of people.

865
00:49:40,915 --> 00:49:42,149
Now where did you
put the warrant?

866
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:43,350
Is it in the records office?

867
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:45,486
Because it doesn't look
like that burned down.

868
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:47,120
Get out of the courthouse.

869
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:49,791
I have jurisdiction!

870
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:51,458
I will deal with him.

871
00:49:57,665 --> 00:49:59,567
- Tommy.
- What?

872
00:49:59,634 --> 00:50:01,001
You're not thinking straight.

873
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,436
I've been thinking
straight all night.

874
00:50:02,504 --> 00:50:03,605
Yeah.

875
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,908
We got sent here with a
warrant issued by this county.

876
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,209
Benjamin Bonney
is killing people

877
00:50:09,276 --> 00:50:11,245
and somehow somebody
in this county

878
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:13,247
lost the only piece of evidence

879
00:50:13,313 --> 00:50:15,215
tying the Bonneys
to the murders.

880
00:50:15,282 --> 00:50:19,219
And then, like magic, that
warrant is suddenly pulled.

881
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:20,955
Now who do you think
pulled it, Frank?

882
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,891
John F. Kennedy, huh?

883
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:29,797
Somebody in this goddamn
shithole town is crooked.

884
00:50:29,864 --> 00:50:31,566
Yes, they are.

885
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:33,267
Hey, they're crooked,

886
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,569
- all right?
- Yeah.

887
00:50:34,636 --> 00:50:35,870
So what?

888
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:38,405
So somebody fucking
died last night, Frank!

889
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:41,275
Okay, flyboy, what are
you gonna do about it?

890
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:43,210
Do you think whoever
remanded that warrant

891
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:44,612
signed their name at the bottom,

892
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,914
filed it in permanent records?

893
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,447
We are done.

894
00:50:47,515 --> 00:50:48,883
We are going home.

895
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:49,817
Accept it.

896
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:55,757
Maybe, I think maybe
there's a chance.

897
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:59,594
And maybe it's worth
looking at the land records

898
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:01,896
from that year just
because everything else

899
00:51:01,963 --> 00:51:03,196
went up in ashes, Frank.

900
00:51:03,263 --> 00:51:05,934
And I think maybe you
might actually give a shit

901
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,535
if your balls weren't
permanently locked up

902
00:51:07,602 --> 00:51:09,136
in a cabinet since 1945.

903
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:10,972
Drop the folders.

904
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:13,508
Drop them right now and
let me see your hands.

905
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,678
Daniel?

906
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:20,648
What the hell are you doing?
Man, I almost shot you.

907
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:22,850
Goddamn, brother.

908
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:24,351
Never thought I'd
run into you again.

909
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:25,954
Not in the middle of the
desert, that's for sure.

910
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,188
What has
it been, 10 years?

911
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:29,857
More that that I
think, what, '51, right?

912
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,391
Hey, you should have
seen this flyboy.

913
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,827
He was driving
fighters in Korea.

914
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:34,762
Best wingman I ever had.

915
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:35,964
When I wasn't saving your ass.

916
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,899
Oh, no, no, no, uh-uh.

917
00:51:37,966 --> 00:51:39,067
You were saving my ass?

918
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:40,267
I don't think so.

919
00:51:40,334 --> 00:51:41,569
I know a couple of MiG
pilots in parachutes,

920
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:42,336
they'd swear to it.

921
00:51:42,402 --> 00:51:43,303
We're gonna do this again?

922
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:44,371
You know I had that shot.

923
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:45,907
I know you think
you had that shot.

924
00:51:45,974 --> 00:51:49,343
After I saved his ass, we
both got out, went to college.

925
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:50,778
He went Marshals, I went FBI.

926
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:51,980
What are the chances?

927
00:51:52,046 --> 00:51:53,514
So you're FBI.

928
00:51:54,716 --> 00:51:56,818
Yeah, they got us down
on field assignment.

929
00:51:56,884 --> 00:51:58,352
Who's us?

930
00:51:59,954 --> 00:52:01,823
I'm not really
at liberty to say.

931
00:52:01,889 --> 00:52:03,625
You know how that goes.

932
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:04,726
Does the
name Benjamin Bonney

933
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:05,893
mean anything to you?

934
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,327
Whoa.

935
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:08,328
Whoa.

936
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:09,396
No, no, I'm just saying-

937
00:52:09,463 --> 00:52:10,397
- Come on, man.
- we were sent here

938
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:11,899
with a warrant for his arrest

939
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,266
and we get here and suddenly

940
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:15,903
somebody makes the warrant
just disappear.

941
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:19,841
Tommy, you listen to me.

942
00:52:19,907 --> 00:52:21,375
I got a little office here.

943
00:52:21,441 --> 00:52:23,544
I'm doing my job, I like my job.

944
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,646
Okay?

945
00:52:24,712 --> 00:52:26,014
You can't just come in and
pump me for information.

946
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,314
It don't work like that.

947
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:28,883
That's not what I'm doing.

948
00:52:28,983 --> 00:52:30,051
I just need a little
something, man.

949
00:52:30,118 --> 00:52:30,852
Tell me-

950
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,390
Are you on active assignment?

951
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:38,425
That's an excellent question.

952
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:40,193
Mr. Armstrong, they're
U.S. Marshals, sir.

953
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,529
They check out.

954
00:52:41,596 --> 00:52:43,097
That doesn't
answer my question.

955
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:44,899
Are you on
an active assignment?

956
00:52:46,634 --> 00:52:47,969
No, sir.

957
00:52:48,036 --> 00:52:49,904
We are following up
on a recent case.

958
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:51,304
What kind of case?

959
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:53,141
We were called in
by the county

960
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:54,809
to serve a
murder warrant.

961
00:52:55,877 --> 00:52:57,411
Evidence got lost,

962
00:52:57,477 --> 00:53:00,948
so my partner and I were
doing a little follow up.

963
00:53:01,015 --> 00:53:02,650
Murder warrant?

964
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:03,951
Killing over land.

965
00:53:05,653 --> 00:53:07,655
The old ways never
change, do they?

966
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:10,124
Yeah, they do,
if you change them.

967
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,627
Tommy and I, we flew missions
together in Korea, sir.

968
00:53:12,694 --> 00:53:14,595
He's a good pilot,
a very good man.

969
00:53:14,662 --> 00:53:16,496
Investigations are
FBI jurisdiction.

970
00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:19,466
As you no longer have
active warrants to serve,

971
00:53:19,534 --> 00:53:22,603
you'll need to return
to your station.

972
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,639
Carson City.

973
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:26,306
That's a 15 hour drive.

974
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:29,911
Call the air station
at, uh, White Rock

975
00:53:29,977 --> 00:53:30,945
and charter these
gentlemen a flight

976
00:53:31,012 --> 00:53:32,613
tomorrow morning, first thing.

977
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,148
You can, uh, leave the
car at the airport.

978
00:53:34,214 --> 00:53:35,983
We'll take care of it.

979
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,451
Professional courtesy.

980
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,554
That is mighty
kind of you, sir.

981
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:42,890
We will get out of your hair.

982
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,226
Daniel.

983
00:53:49,931 --> 00:53:51,231
Take
care of yourself.

984
00:53:54,102 --> 00:53:55,770
Excuse me, sir.

985
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:14,555
I spent an entire year
taking Chinese flak,

986
00:54:14,622 --> 00:54:16,958
trying to save South Korea
from that madman Kim.

987
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:19,861
It was black and white.

988
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:24,699
You got the good guys over here
and the bad guys over there.

989
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:28,468
You suit up, you go shoot
rockets at the bad guy.

990
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,939
And now the good guys are
shooting rockets at us.

991
00:54:33,174 --> 00:54:35,009
I think
I liked it better

992
00:54:35,076 --> 00:54:36,511
when they were communists.

993
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:37,845
At least it made sense.

994
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:45,620
It doesn't make sense.

995
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,857
It doesn't have to.

996
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,695
7AM?

997
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:58,833
7AM.

998
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:21,556
Hey,

999
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:23,291
Captain.

1000
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:25,927
Something ain't right.

1001
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:33,835
See it?

1002
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:35,570
Yeah, I see it.

1003
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:37,337
Some
kind of signals?

1004
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:40,875
Krauts must be dug in.

1005
00:55:42,844 --> 00:55:44,679
It means there's more
of them out there.

1006
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:47,982
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

1007
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:52,587
Hey, maybe we ought
to let this one go.

1008
00:55:54,354 --> 00:55:56,090
We back off, we go
around these pricks.

1009
00:55:57,225 --> 00:55:58,960
Cut 'em off at their supply.

1010
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:01,829
They'll surrender to the first
unit that comes across 'em.

1011
00:56:03,664 --> 00:56:05,633
Sergeant, every drop of blood

1012
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,835
those Krauts spill
from here on out,

1013
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:13,040
that's on your hands and mine.

1014
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:17,377
So, if you're not willing
to live with that,

1015
00:56:18,846 --> 00:56:20,848
get your rifle
pointed down range.

1016
00:56:22,016 --> 00:56:23,618
Let's take out some bad guys.

1017
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:38,900
Starting to think you got
a thing for being corrupted.

1018
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:44,038
Drinking your problems away?

1019
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:50,978
The intrepid U.S. Marshal.

1020
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:53,080
Badge and gun in his motel room,

1021
00:56:53,147 --> 00:56:55,683
indulges in spirits and barmaids

1022
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,652
just to ease the
pain that he exists.

1023
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,955
What are you doing
here, Benjamin?

1024
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:02,590
What am I doing here?

1025
00:57:05,026 --> 00:57:06,193
I'll have what he's having.

1026
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,628
Make it two.

1027
00:57:08,495 --> 00:57:10,865
I spent my day on top of
my roof plugging holes

1028
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:12,633
so that when it
snows next month,

1029
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,969
it doesn't, it doesn't
drain down into the house

1030
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:17,939
and onto the holes on the
floor that I just patched.

1031
00:57:18,572 --> 00:57:19,707
It's November.

1032
00:57:19,774 --> 00:57:21,042
It's damn hot and I
worked up a sweat,

1033
00:57:21,108 --> 00:57:22,677
so I reckon I,

1034
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:24,712
thank you,

1035
00:57:24,779 --> 00:57:26,881
deserve a respite
for my troubles.

1036
00:57:26,948 --> 00:57:28,015
What do you say?

1037
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:31,252
You put that on his tab.

1038
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,186
He owes me one.

1039
00:57:33,788 --> 00:57:36,324
You here to shoot
up my room again?

1040
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,292
Someone shot up your room?

1041
00:57:38,359 --> 00:57:39,327
You got a lot of nerve.

1042
00:57:41,162 --> 00:57:42,430
I would love nothing more

1043
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:45,099
than to blow your insides
out all over this bar.

1044
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,002
Can't think of a
good reason yet.

1045
00:57:52,406 --> 00:57:54,075
Go on, drink it.

1046
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:01,248
Drink it.

1047
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:13,160
Now...

1048
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:20,801
I'm gonna tell you a story,
Marshal, about my mother dying.

1049
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:23,904
Bartender, two more.

1050
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:26,507
Doubles.

1051
00:58:26,574 --> 00:58:28,509
She was killed on her own ranch,

1052
00:58:28,576 --> 00:58:29,777
the one you just shot up,

1053
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:32,146
during an insurrection
of the Paiute Indians

1054
00:58:32,213 --> 00:58:33,814
and the federal government.

1055
00:58:35,082 --> 00:58:36,150
Was shot in the stomach.

1056
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,786
My father held
her while she died

1057
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:41,088
while I sat there
inside watching.

1058
00:58:43,057 --> 00:58:44,892
She was killed by
a 10-year-old boy.

1059
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:51,332
Go on now.

1060
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:04,545
I knew that boy.

1061
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:05,980
His name was Tu-cu-pit.

1062
00:59:06,047 --> 00:59:08,482
That's Paiute speak
for a mountain lion.

1063
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:10,084
He shot her in the stomach.

1064
00:59:11,085 --> 00:59:13,721
She died right there on
the ranch you just shot up.

1065
00:59:13,788 --> 00:59:15,256
My father held
her while she died

1066
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:16,924
and I stood inside watching.

1067
00:59:20,161 --> 00:59:21,195
Pour two more.

1068
00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:27,668
Eventually, the federals
crushed the uprising

1069
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:29,904
and killed all the
leaders and it was over.

1070
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:32,173
And Tu-cu-pit was still alive

1071
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:34,375
and he went back to his
boarding school the next week

1072
00:59:34,442 --> 00:59:36,110
like nothing happened.

1073
00:59:38,446 --> 00:59:40,047
You know what I did?

1074
00:59:41,415 --> 00:59:42,583
What?

1075
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,918
I found his boarding school

1076
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:48,055
and I watched him from
the woods for a month,

1077
00:59:48,122 --> 00:59:49,990
watching him learn
how to plant corn.

1078
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:53,894
Then one day, he was alone,

1079
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,997
so I took a rock, hit him
in the back of the head.

1080
00:59:57,064 --> 00:59:59,867
And I kept on hitting him
until his skull cracked.

1081
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:01,735
Then I dragged his
body into a ditch

1082
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:03,237
and then I pulled
out my jackknife

1083
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:06,874
and in the rage of a child,
I did what a child would do.

1084
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,743
I cut off his head.

1085
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,248
That's, add two more.

1086
01:00:14,315 --> 01:00:15,349
Come on now.

1087
01:00:17,552 --> 01:00:18,953
You know how I felt?

1088
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,490
- How did-
- Not the slightest

1089
01:00:22,557 --> 01:00:24,024
bit guilty.

1090
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:25,993
Slept like a baby.

1091
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:28,262
From that day on,

1092
01:00:28,329 --> 01:00:30,931
I never lost a minute of
sleep for killing that boy.

1093
01:00:35,402 --> 01:00:36,837
Drink.

1094
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,813
Anyone who survived
the insurrection,

1095
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,681
they knew Tu-cu-pit
had killed my mother,

1096
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:51,318
so they assumed my father
cut his head off in revenge.

1097
01:00:52,554 --> 01:00:54,922
So the next day,
they shot my father

1098
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,690
right in his own front yard.

1099
01:00:58,627 --> 01:01:00,194
Naturally, they
cut his head off.

1100
01:01:02,096 --> 01:01:03,063
No more mother.

1101
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:05,534
No more father.

1102
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,768
No more 10,000 acres
I lost to the bank.

1103
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:11,405
All for making sure that
that kid got his comeuppance.

1104
01:01:19,947 --> 01:01:22,750
Now, as a U.S. Marshal,

1105
01:01:23,884 --> 01:01:26,220
I'm sure that you
feel really inspired

1106
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,423
to follow every injustice
down to the end of a rope.

1107
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:37,031
The point I'm
trying to make here,

1108
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:39,733
that sometimes you need to know

1109
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,069
when to go back to your
fucking house and stay there.

1110
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:48,275
Those are for you, honey.

1111
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:49,243
I don't drink.

1112
01:02:06,327 --> 01:02:07,562
Four bucks.

1113
01:02:07,629 --> 01:02:09,830
And you still owe me a drink.

1114
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,137
You all right?

1115
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,377
There's a time I had the fire
to do something about that.

1116
01:02:27,147 --> 01:02:30,017
I don't know if I need to
feed that fire or put it out.

1117
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:40,160
Might be best to not ever
light it to begin with.

1118
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,863
World's got enough fires.

1119
01:02:43,964 --> 01:02:45,966
Fire by an outlaw's hand

1120
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:48,335
or being vaporized
in a nuclear inferno.

1121
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,906
Either way, the whole
world's consumed by it.

1122
01:02:54,542 --> 01:02:56,043
Everybody burns.

1123
01:03:30,679 --> 01:03:32,112
Got a light?

1124
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:45,826
Frank?

1125
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:50,864
Frank, is that you?

1126
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:52,232
It's Danny, open up.

1127
01:03:54,468 --> 01:03:55,469
It's unlocked.

1128
01:03:57,438 --> 01:03:59,106
We need to talk.

1129
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:05,379
Come on in.

1130
01:04:15,456 --> 01:04:16,323
You're hungry.

1131
01:04:17,826 --> 01:04:20,294
You're smoking
cigarettes and drinking

1132
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:22,096
after years of sobriety,

1133
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:25,165
'cause you're hungry
for something.

1134
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:31,238
Well, once in a while
a guy's gotta cut loose.

1135
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:35,510
You knocked on my door
because you have an urgency,

1136
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,213
a burning desire deep
inside you, Frank,

1137
01:04:39,279 --> 01:04:41,281
to break out of
your constraints.

1138
01:04:44,151 --> 01:04:46,521
You know how Jacob
came to Gilead?

1139
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:48,656
Jacob who?

1140
01:04:48,723 --> 01:04:50,324
Jacob from the Bible.

1141
01:04:50,391 --> 01:04:51,225
Yeah, right.

1142
01:04:51,291 --> 01:04:52,126
Uh...

1143
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:57,532
No, I don't know how Jacob
came to be in Gilead.

1144
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:01,770
Because he was traveling
to reconcile his burdens.

1145
01:05:01,836 --> 01:05:03,638
And the Lord chose Gilead

1146
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,374
as the place of reconciliation.

1147
01:05:10,344 --> 01:05:11,546
Good to know.

1148
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:33,367
In Gilead, he was transformed.

1149
01:05:34,736 --> 01:05:38,205
Have you ever embarked on
a psychedelic trip before?

1150
01:05:38,907 --> 01:05:40,040
No.

1151
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:42,510
I think you're long overdue.

1152
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:45,279
Smoke it.

1153
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,518
What's the jig, Daniel?

1154
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:51,786
No jig, just deep shit.

1155
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:52,754
- Deep shit, huh?
- Yeah.

1156
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:54,522
Okay, so you're here to what?

1157
01:05:54,589 --> 01:05:55,824
Scare me away again?

1158
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:57,859
Tommy, you remember
the Pusan run?

1159
01:05:57,926 --> 01:06:01,228
January of '51, K9 airbase.

1160
01:06:01,295 --> 01:06:02,730
- Yeah.
- Couple of MIG-15s?

1161
01:06:03,765 --> 01:06:05,700
Yeah, I remember
the Pusan run.

1162
01:06:05,767 --> 01:06:06,568
You remember what happened?

1163
01:06:06,634 --> 01:06:07,735
We lost Joker.

1164
01:06:07,802 --> 01:06:09,737
Joker wasn't supposed
to fly that day.

1165
01:06:09,804 --> 01:06:11,573
He felt a sense of duty.

1166
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:12,907
Leapfrogged the roster,

1167
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:16,143
flew himself in front
of a MiG ace's cannon,

1168
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,512
and that was the end.

1169
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:20,981
All the honor, all the
glory, 21 gun salute

1170
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:24,519
and wings punching the top
of his coffin, still dead.

1171
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:25,787
That's you right now.

1172
01:06:25,854 --> 01:06:27,020
You're Joker.

1173
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:28,989
Stay on the base, Tommy.

1174
01:06:29,791 --> 01:06:31,225
Sit this one out.

1175
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:38,600
I'm not built for hanging
back at base, Danny.

1176
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:42,269
I'll take my chances
getting shot.

1177
01:06:43,805 --> 01:06:45,272
I gotta see this through.

1178
01:06:47,742 --> 01:06:49,042
I tried.

1179
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:03,056
My boss made that
shell casing disappear.

1180
01:07:03,123 --> 01:07:06,794
Galen Armstrong, he got
rid of the only evidence.

1181
01:07:06,861 --> 01:07:10,430
The only evidence tying
the Bonneys to the murders.

1182
01:07:13,635 --> 01:07:14,769
He's the one that
torched the archives

1183
01:07:14,836 --> 01:07:16,704
and remanded the warrant.

1184
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:17,906
I don't know why.

1185
01:07:17,972 --> 01:07:19,473
He's got something
cooking and it's bad.

1186
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:22,610
The Bonneys are killing people.

1187
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,044
Armstrong's letting it happen.

1188
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:33,922
Whose side are you on, Daniel?

1189
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:36,356
Fair winds and
following seas, brother.

1190
01:07:57,344 --> 01:08:00,080
Transformations are spiritual.

1191
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:06,654
Jacob's transformation
was spiritual,

1192
01:08:06,721 --> 01:08:08,723
but it was a physical encounter.

1193
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:12,326
He woke up in the
middle of the night,

1194
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:14,963
sleeping by the road to Gilead,

1195
01:08:15,063 --> 01:08:19,567
and found himself
wrestling with an angel.

1196
01:08:22,937 --> 01:08:24,739
The angel took
the form of a man,

1197
01:08:25,673 --> 01:08:28,810
and there Jacob
wrestled with that man

1198
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:30,878
till the breaking of the day.

1199
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:32,479
Let me go.

1200
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:36,884
And when the man saw that
Jacob prevailed against him,

1201
01:08:39,587 --> 01:08:41,889
he touched the
hollow of his thigh.

1202
01:08:41,956 --> 01:08:43,057
No.

1203
01:08:44,759 --> 01:08:48,563
And the hollow of Jacob's
thigh was out of joint

1204
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:50,197
as he wrestled with him.

1205
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:56,169
And that man said, "Let me go!"

1206
01:08:58,138 --> 01:08:59,641
The day breaketh,

1207
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:05,747
and he says, "I
will not let thee go

1208
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:07,447
until thou bless me."

1209
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:15,623
And the angel blessed him there.

1210
01:09:28,036 --> 01:09:29,937
Your struggle, Frank.

1211
01:09:31,171 --> 01:09:33,941
You're wrestling with an angel.

1212
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,178
You're wrestling with yourself.

1213
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:48,089
You ready to do this?

1214
01:09:48,156 --> 01:09:50,591
Let's shoot 'em out
the goddamn window, sir.

1215
01:09:53,895 --> 01:09:54,996
Be prepared to cover me

1216
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:56,964
if we start taking
fire from the woods.

1217
01:09:58,132 --> 01:09:58,866
Ready?

1218
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:04,471
Go!

1219
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:06,007
Go!

1220
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:09,010
Till the fucking
house is falling!

1221
01:10:09,077 --> 01:10:12,312
"Death be not proud."

1222
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:15,750
Let's go kill them
fucking Nazis.

1223
01:10:24,592 --> 01:10:29,463
"Though some call thee
mighty and dreadful,

1224
01:10:29,564 --> 01:10:31,532
thou are not so.

1225
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:37,505
Those whom thou thinkest
thou dost overthrow die not!

1226
01:10:40,108 --> 01:10:44,579
Poor death nor yet
canst thou kill me

1227
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,516
from rest and sleep.

1228
01:10:48,583 --> 01:10:50,484
Rest!

1229
01:10:50,551 --> 01:10:53,621
Their bones and soul's delivery!

1230
01:10:54,789 --> 01:10:57,892
Poppy or charms make
us sleep as well.

1231
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:01,896
And better than thy stroke!

1232
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:05,666
Why swellest thou then?

1233
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:10,270
One short sleep past,
we wake eternally.

1234
01:11:11,606 --> 01:11:13,975
And death shall be no more."

1235
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:19,379
"Death shall die."

1236
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:27,588
Jacob called the place of
his struggle, He Who Strives.

1237
01:11:28,623 --> 01:11:31,225
For I have seen
God face to face,

1238
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:33,528
and my life is preserved.

1239
01:11:34,629 --> 01:11:37,464
For Jacob was righteous
in the eyes of the Lord.

1240
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,603
We're shooting rockets
at the North Koreans.

1241
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:44,672
What are you
talking about, Frank?

1242
01:11:45,773 --> 01:11:47,975
You said you liked
shooting at the bad guys.

1243
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:51,411
We know where the bad guys are.

1244
01:11:53,446 --> 01:11:54,782
Let's shoot at them.

1245
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:57,251
What are you on, Frank?

1246
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,753
Remember this?

1247
01:12:00,288 --> 01:12:01,923
That's every land
deed and bill of sale

1248
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,090
in Paiute County this year.

1249
01:12:03,157 --> 01:12:04,926
Every one of them deeded
to Benjamin Bonney

1250
01:12:04,992 --> 01:12:06,561
for pennies on the dollar.

1251
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:07,929
He's murdering to create a panic

1252
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:10,665
and buying out everyone
within 20 miles of his ranch.

1253
01:12:11,799 --> 01:12:14,001
This is all
circumstantial evidence.

1254
01:12:16,237 --> 01:12:17,839
But lucky for us,

1255
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,477
that's no longer our problem.

1256
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:27,048
Pack your rockets, Tommy.

1257
01:12:28,348 --> 01:12:29,349
There's a war on.

1258
01:12:41,662 --> 01:12:44,999
The Bonneys have been
in that barn for an hour.

1259
01:12:45,066 --> 01:12:46,000
They're not coming out.

1260
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:53,007
Then we're going in.

1261
01:12:53,074 --> 01:12:54,575
You got the duffel, right?

1262
01:12:56,177 --> 01:12:57,044
Yeah.

1263
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,082
You sure that's how
you want to play this?

1264
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:04,051
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

1265
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:06,621
We're gonna get Bonney,

1266
01:13:06,687 --> 01:13:08,623
we're gonna take down Armstrong,

1267
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:12,226
or we're gonna wind
up dead or in prison.

1268
01:13:12,293 --> 01:13:13,628
That all right with you?

1269
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:16,964
Better to die a hero
than live as a coward.

1270
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:19,734
That's the spirit.

1271
01:13:22,136 --> 01:13:23,671
Let's get 'em, cowboy.

1272
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:48,663
Don't move!

1273
01:13:48,729 --> 01:13:49,964
U.S. Marshals,
you're under arrest.

1274
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:54,001
Don't do it.

1275
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:56,871
Don't.

1276
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:56,891
Tommy, you need to see this.

1277
01:16:02,496 --> 01:16:04,198
Holy shit.

1278
01:16:05,099 --> 01:16:08,235
was
shot just below the shoulder,

1279
01:16:08,302 --> 01:16:09,703
according to

1280
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,439
who spoke with the
governor at the hospital

1281
01:16:11,506 --> 01:16:12,606
where he.

1282
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,911
asked where
the shooter came from,

1283
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:19,747
and the Governor
replied, "I don't know.

1284
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:21,048
I guess from the back."

1285
01:16:21,115 --> 01:16:22,183
Benjamin Bonney.

1286
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,453
You are under arrest
for capital murder.

1287
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,054
Do not make any sudden
moves, either of you.

1288
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:28,289
What the hell is this?

1289
01:16:28,355 --> 01:16:29,957
Yeah, how'd you get in here?

1290
01:16:30,024 --> 01:16:31,425
Where are my sons?

1291
01:16:31,492 --> 01:16:33,127
Noah and Ahab are dead.

1292
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:35,496
That's right.

1293
01:16:35,564 --> 01:16:37,665
You tell us where Joe is,
and maybe he survives.

1294
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:41,068
You can't make an
arrest without a warrant.

1295
01:16:41,135 --> 01:16:43,804
See, a little birdie showed
up on our doorstep last night

1296
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:45,372
with your missing evidence.

1297
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:48,275
That's probable cause.

1298
01:16:53,981 --> 01:16:55,015
Gentlemen,

1299
01:16:56,317 --> 01:16:59,720
this is our insurance policy.

1300
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:04,024
You're gonna answer some
questions on the record.

1301
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,794
Mr. Armstrong, I'm aware

1302
01:17:06,861 --> 01:17:08,996
that you can make a
shell casing disappear.

1303
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,932
But this recording is getting
air-mailed to Washington.

1304
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:14,101
And you will not
make that disappear.

1305
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:17,004
So why don't we start
with where the hell we are?

1306
01:17:18,005 --> 01:17:19,940
Why's there a rocket down here?

1307
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:22,743
<i>The President</i>

1313
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:36,123
<i>the oath of</i>

1314

1315
01:17:37,925 --> 01:17:39,727
<i>who was shot by a</i>
<i>would-be assassin-</i>

1316
01:17:39,793 --> 01:17:40,961
You telling me

1317
01:17:41,028 --> 01:17:43,430
that the President of the
United States is dead?

1318
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:47,368
And you had something
to do with it?

1319
01:17:47,434 --> 01:17:48,802
What's going on?

1320
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:52,473
It's a new world
and the end of yours.

1321
01:17:54,241 --> 01:17:55,209
Stay where you are.

1322
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:57,211
Don't move, I've
got you in my sights!

1323
01:17:58,913 --> 01:18:02,249
That would be my daughter,

1324
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:03,184
Jo.

1325
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:04,985
What the hell
are you doing here?

1326
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:06,487
Drop your guns, both of you.

1327
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:09,023
You shoot and Daddy here dies!

1328
01:18:09,089 --> 01:18:11,225
Frank, I've got your
partner in my sights.

1329
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:13,327
Tell him to drop his gun.

1330
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:19,033
You got no choice,
drop your guns.

1331
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:20,334
Not gonna happen.

1332
01:18:20,401 --> 01:18:21,202
What the hell are you doing?

1333
01:18:21,268 --> 01:18:22,036
Why are you here?

1334
01:18:22,102 --> 01:18:22,736
Drop your guns!

1335
01:18:22,803 --> 01:18:24,205
I'm gonna blow his brains out!

1336
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:25,239
Hey!

1337
01:18:25,306 --> 01:18:27,509
Hey, you want a confession?

1338
01:18:27,576 --> 01:18:28,809
I'll give you a confession.

1339
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:30,545
We're standing in
a missile silo.

1340
01:18:30,612 --> 01:18:32,112
What you saw in the other room

1341
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:35,916
is a rocket with an atom bomb
strapped to the top of it.

1342
01:18:35,983 --> 01:18:39,920
Those Soviet engineers
from Angola or whatever

1343
01:18:39,987 --> 01:18:41,523
have been down here building
it for what purposes,

1344
01:18:41,623 --> 01:18:43,090
I don't know and I-I don't care.

1345
01:18:43,157 --> 01:18:44,758
If you want to
know, you ask him.

1346
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:49,664
I personally don't give
one single solitary fuck

1347
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,999
about the Soviets
or the missiles.

1348
01:18:52,066 --> 01:18:53,000
Me?

1349
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:56,370
I just like a good deal.

1350
01:18:57,905 --> 01:19:00,575
And that's what Mr.
Armstrong proposed to me.

1351
01:19:00,642 --> 01:19:02,209
Yeah, he wanted his privacy.

1352
01:19:02,276 --> 01:19:04,111
He didn't want neighbors
snooping around.

1353
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:05,045
I heard that.

1354
01:19:05,112 --> 01:19:05,913
Made a deal.

1355
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:08,282
What I do is keep
the locals away

1356
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:11,285
by any means at my
disposal.

1357
01:19:11,352 --> 01:19:15,089
Yeah, and he makes sure
the scrutiny goes away.

1358
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:18,292
You let him murder
with impunity?

1359
01:19:20,662 --> 01:19:21,929
For land?

1360
01:19:21,996 --> 01:19:24,599
Yeah, you're goddamn
right, Marshals.

1361
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:26,333
I'm killing for land, yeah.

1362
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:28,637
I want that land.

1363
01:19:28,703 --> 01:19:29,837
That's my land.

1364
01:19:29,903 --> 01:19:31,472
It's always been my land.

1365
01:19:32,206 --> 01:19:33,508
That land will be mine
for a thousand years.

1366
01:19:33,575 --> 01:19:37,579
That will be my land without
any consequences at all.

1367
01:19:37,646 --> 01:19:38,946
I own you, I own your badges,

1368
01:19:39,013 --> 01:19:40,914
I own your family,
I own your asses.

1369
01:19:40,981 --> 01:19:42,584
Put down your guns,
get on your knees,

1370
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:44,586
and pray to whatever
God you can think of

1371
01:19:44,653 --> 01:19:48,856
that we don't slash you from
your asshole to your elbows

1372
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:52,694
and leave your guts
bleaching in the sun.

1373
01:19:52,761 --> 01:19:55,062
That's your only chance,
you cherry fucks.

1374
01:19:57,298 --> 01:19:58,098
You better take it.

1375
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,335
You killed the president?

1376
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:03,103
You're goddamn right we did.

1377
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:07,174
So what power do
you think you have?

1378
01:20:29,531 --> 01:20:30,699
Get him!

1379
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:41,408
Dr. Hansi, we have a code nine.

1380
01:20:43,578 --> 01:20:45,145
You know what to do.

1381
01:21:08,636 --> 01:21:10,337
I don't speak Russian.

1382
01:21:12,306 --> 01:21:13,941
Who are you?

1383
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:15,342
Are you with Mr. Armstrong?

1384
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:16,343
No, I'm not.

1385
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:18,580
What is this?

1386
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:22,983
This is your day of reckoning.

1387
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:26,286
What kind of reckoning?

1388
01:21:29,624 --> 01:21:31,492
You are in a missile silo.

1389
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,495
Why don't you do the math?

1390
01:21:34,562 --> 01:21:35,496
You're launching it?

1391
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:38,198
At what?

1392
01:21:39,868 --> 01:21:41,402
Tell me.

1393
01:21:44,304 --> 01:21:45,139
Hey!

1394
01:21:46,407 --> 01:21:48,743
I've got your scientist.

1395
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:52,045
What is this, Armstrong?

1396
01:21:52,647 --> 01:21:54,181
You launching a missile?

1397
01:21:55,315 --> 01:21:56,283
Marshal...

1398
01:22:01,455 --> 01:22:02,356
I'm, uh...

1399
01:22:03,858 --> 01:22:05,492
I'm going to explain
something to you.

1400
01:22:06,427 --> 01:22:10,030
Imagine you have a,
a Russian soldier

1401
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:12,199
with a gun pointing
at your head.

1402
01:22:13,200 --> 01:22:14,836
Now, if he fires, you die

1403
01:22:14,903 --> 01:22:17,772
before you can get
off a shot in defense.

1404
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:19,808
But he's not going to fire

1405
01:22:19,874 --> 01:22:22,142
because you have 1,000
American soldiers

1406
01:22:22,242 --> 01:22:24,344
standing behind you
pointing guns at him.

1407
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:30,284
If he shoots, you
die, but so does he.

1408
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:33,086
It's mutually
assured destruction.

1409
01:22:34,722 --> 01:22:36,390
If I turn that key,

1410
01:22:37,759 --> 01:22:39,861
the nuclear missile
in the next room

1411
01:22:39,928 --> 01:22:42,062
will launch into the
city of Los Angeles.

1412
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:44,833
You can't stop it.

1413
01:22:44,899 --> 01:22:48,068
But if you put down your gun,

1414
01:22:49,403 --> 01:22:53,407
you have a historic,
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

1415
01:22:53,474 --> 01:22:56,243
to convince me to
change my mind.

1416
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:00,882
Why should I believe you?

1417
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:02,851
You could
gamble with the lives

1418
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:05,986
of every man, woman, and
child in Los Angeles,

1419
01:23:06,053 --> 01:23:07,822
if you prefer.

1420
01:23:33,615 --> 01:23:35,048
All right, Frank.

1421
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:37,184
Save Los Angeles.

1422
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:40,454
Tell me to fire the
missile somewhere else.

1423
01:23:41,623 --> 01:23:42,557
Say it.

1424
01:23:44,491 --> 01:23:46,460
Fire the missile
somewhere else.

1425
01:23:47,996 --> 01:23:49,129
Okay.

1426
01:23:53,668 --> 01:23:55,369
What are you doing?

1427
01:23:55,435 --> 01:23:57,404
I am reprogramming the missile

1428
01:23:57,471 --> 01:23:59,239
to land on the
bustling metropolis

1429
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:03,410
of Cactus City, California,
population zero.

1430
01:24:03,477 --> 01:24:04,646
It's a ghost town.

1431
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:06,413
This is not part of the plan.

1432
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,816
The plans were to wait
successful news about the-

1433
01:24:08,883 --> 01:24:10,952
Of the killing of
President Kennedy,

1434
01:24:11,019 --> 01:24:13,253
and then launch the
missile at Los Angeles.

1435
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,756
We're changing the plan.

1436
01:24:14,822 --> 01:24:16,658
We're saving the world.

1437
01:24:16,724 --> 01:24:18,492
You cannot change the plan.

1438
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,459
You cannot!

1439
01:24:19,527 --> 01:24:20,628
You cannot!

1440
01:24:20,695 --> 01:24:22,362
We just did, Dr. Hansi.

1441
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:25,332
I just saved America
from a Russian plot

1442
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:29,436
to destroy Los Angeles from
one of America's own silos.

1443
01:24:29,503 --> 01:24:30,838
I'm a hero.

1444
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:32,507
You killed the president.

1445
01:24:32,574 --> 01:24:34,441
I killed the rot that's
plagued this country

1446
01:24:34,509 --> 01:24:36,410
since Stalin
marched into Berlin.

1447
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,112
When that missile
lands in the desert,

1448
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:41,616
the whole world will think
Russia killed the president,

1449
01:24:41,683 --> 01:24:43,851
and launched an atomic
bomb at Los Angeles

1450
01:24:43,918 --> 01:24:45,853
and missed by the grace of God.

1451
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:48,957
Flattening a ghost
town's not enough

1452
01:24:49,023 --> 01:24:52,060
to justify wiping Russia off
the map with our own arsenal,

1453
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,628
but it stops every
politician in this country

1454
01:24:53,695 --> 01:24:56,463
from coddling the
Reds once and for all.

1455
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:59,000
I just made every wobbly-kneed,
fence-sitting senator

1456
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:01,335
and fifth-column voters' league

1457
01:25:01,401 --> 01:25:03,503
opposing the defense
of this country

1458
01:25:03,571 --> 01:25:06,674
just as much a danger
as Moscow itself.

1459
01:25:06,741 --> 01:25:08,543
Hell, I just got every
nation in the West

1460
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:09,611
to stand up and commit

1461
01:25:09,677 --> 01:25:11,311
to stopping the, the
spread of communism

1462
01:25:11,378 --> 01:25:13,548
to Chile and Vietnam.

1463
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:16,718
I'm a patriot, Frank.

1464
01:25:17,852 --> 01:25:18,686
What are you?

1465
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:21,723
It's not
too late to stop this.

1466
01:25:24,191 --> 01:25:27,327
I'm sorry about your father,
but it's not too late.

1467
01:25:28,395 --> 01:25:30,598
My father's death
served a greater cause.

1468
01:25:30,665 --> 01:25:31,633
It's like I told you.

1469
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:35,335
If you're preparing for
war, you've already lost it.

1470
01:25:42,644 --> 01:25:44,144
You cannot do this!

1471
01:25:44,211 --> 01:25:48,348
You made a deal with
Moscow, you treasonous scum!

1472
01:25:48,415 --> 01:25:50,150
You're going to burn
in hell for this!

1473
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,318
Do you hear me?

1474
01:25:51,385 --> 01:25:53,021
You're going to burn!

1475
01:25:56,356 --> 01:25:57,725
Jo.

1476
01:25:57,792 --> 01:25:59,594
Do you know the protocol?

1477
01:25:59,661 --> 01:26:00,595
I know the protocol.

1478
01:26:01,796 --> 01:26:02,764
Prepare the launch sequence.

1479
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:05,066
I want this thing in
the air in 10 minutes.

1480
01:26:05,133 --> 01:26:06,534
Get our man of
Mexico on the line.

1481
01:26:06,601 --> 01:26:08,870
See if he's got full
confirmation on Kennedy.

1482
01:26:08,936 --> 01:26:10,571
Looked pretty dead to me.

1483
01:26:10,638 --> 01:26:12,674
Any chance they
can survive this?

1484
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:15,743
It's gonna be 6,000 degrees
when this thing goes up.

1485
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:18,546
Won't be so much as a
pile of ashes left over.

1486
01:26:18,613 --> 01:26:20,648
Come on, let's get
'er in the air.

1487
01:26:24,451 --> 01:26:27,955
"And now, I am become death.

1488
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:32,927
Destroyer of worlds."

1489
01:26:36,731 --> 01:26:39,499
So this is it, huh?

1490
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:41,703
We're cooked?

1491
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:45,472
More or less.

1492
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,675
But that doesn't mean
we can't stop them.

1493
01:26:48,910 --> 01:26:49,944
Stop them how?

1494
01:26:53,681 --> 01:26:56,918
You're saying we could, we
can turn this thing off?

1495
01:26:56,984 --> 01:26:58,786
Quite easily.

1496
01:26:58,853 --> 01:27:01,388
There is no permissive
action link on the warhead.

1497
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:04,726
I can run up there
with a screwdriver

1498
01:27:04,792 --> 01:27:06,460
and pull a few wires.

1499
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,529
But I am not going to do that.

1500
01:27:08,596 --> 01:27:10,665
What do you mean
you're not gonna do that?

1501
01:27:10,732 --> 01:27:11,733
Why?

1502
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:16,537
Because it is
now my sworn duty

1503
01:27:16,604 --> 01:27:19,006
to give them a taste
of their own medicine.

1504
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:23,310
Only a fool would
trust that man.

1505
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,479
And I am not a fool!

1506
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:27,949
So I built an electronic
release on a fuel valve.

1507
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:32,019
And now, it's armed.

1508
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:36,858
We flip this switch and rocket
fuel starts bleeding out.

1509
01:27:36,924 --> 01:27:38,926
Slow enough they won't notice.

1510
01:27:38,993 --> 01:27:40,161
10 minutes later,

1511
01:27:40,228 --> 01:27:41,829
the charge goes off
next to the oxider seal,

1512
01:27:41,896 --> 01:27:45,867
the gas mixes, and 150
tons of rocket fuel

1513
01:27:45,933 --> 01:27:47,735
goes off in half a second.

1514
01:27:49,737 --> 01:27:50,938
And that is the end.

1515
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:52,874
No.

1516
01:27:54,742 --> 01:27:55,643
Disarm it!

1517
01:27:55,743 --> 01:27:58,411
You crawl up there
and you disarm it!

1518
01:27:59,247 --> 01:28:01,582
We can live to
fight another day.

1519
01:28:01,649 --> 01:28:05,686
If you know how to reprogram
a D-17 main frame computer

1520
01:28:05,753 --> 01:28:07,989
and fly this missile
into the ocean,

1521
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:10,958
then we live to
fight another day.

1522
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:16,097
But that won't stop Mr.
Armstrong and those maniacs.

1523
01:28:16,164 --> 01:28:17,965
It will only slow them down.

1524
01:28:20,134 --> 01:28:21,969
So it's his plan or mine.

1525
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:23,671
Choose!

1526
01:28:25,438 --> 01:28:26,641
Kennedy's dead.

1527
01:28:27,809 --> 01:28:30,978
Then, uh, you'll
need the launch code.

1528
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:34,582
Your plan will kill them.

1529
01:28:34,649 --> 01:28:35,616
Right?

1530
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:41,122
We are talking about
150 tons of rocket fuel.

1531
01:28:41,923 --> 01:28:46,459
That is enough to put a blast
door into solid granite.

1532
01:28:47,795 --> 01:28:49,096
Do it.

1533
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:56,938
It's a go.

1534
01:29:18,726 --> 01:29:21,696
It is a nice day to
die for your country.

1535
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:32,673
How long we got?

1536
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:33,741
Five minutes.

1537
01:29:34,407 --> 01:29:35,676
Where's Tommy?

1538
01:29:36,544 --> 01:29:37,845
He gave 'em hell.

1539
01:29:43,885 --> 01:29:45,987
Let's go. Let's go.

1540
01:30:03,671 --> 01:30:04,906
Farewell, old friend.

1541
01:30:20,554 --> 01:30:22,156
To a better world.

1542
01:30:31,232 --> 01:30:32,432
Oh, my.

1543
01:31:11,672 --> 01:31:13,841
Are you the chaplain?

1544
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:18,045
Do you see what I've done?

1545
01:31:20,414 --> 01:31:23,084
Redemption is a
long road, Frank.

1546
01:31:27,455 --> 01:31:30,057
This is your road to Gilead.

1547
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:34,762
What do I do now?

1548
01:31:38,299 --> 01:31:40,101
Vavavoom.

1549
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:41,168
Drive it, baby.
